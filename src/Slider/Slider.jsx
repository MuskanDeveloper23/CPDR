        <h1>Polishing Genocide: Israel’s Desperate War to Erase History</h1>
        <p>Israel’s ongoing campaign reflects not only a brutal assault on Palestinian
             lives but also a deliberate attempt to erase their history, identity, and cultural memory. 
             From destroying homes and archives to targeting schools, journalists, and historical sites,
              the strategy goes beyond warfare—it seeks to rewrite the narrative by eliminating the very evidence of a people’s existence. This systematic erasure is not accidental; it is a calculated effort to silence generations, hide crimes, and replace truth with manufactured legitimacy. In trying to “polish” its image, Israel exposes a deeper desperation: the fear that documented history will outlive its weapons. True history cannot be bombed into silence;
             each act of destruction only strengthens the world’s resolve to remember what they are trying to erase.</p>
